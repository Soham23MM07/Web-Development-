Window--> webpage

The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. 

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.

The Browser Object Model (BOM) is the core of JavaScript on the web. The BOM provides you with objects that expose the web browser’s functionality.
